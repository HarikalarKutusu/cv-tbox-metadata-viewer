# Common Voice ToolBox - Metadata Viewer

WepApp for examining Common Voice metadata

## Description

Metadata for Mozilla Common Voice releases are published as separate json files after each release in a separate github repository. They contain basic, but important information dataset engineers, community managers or trainers frequently reference. On the other hand accessing this information on a github repo and finding what you are looking for in a large json file is very time consuming, especially if you work on multiple languages, multiple versions and want to compare them.

This utility tries to solve this problem. It uses a flattened dataframe file generated by the Toolbox utility and uses it like an embedded "database" to interactively show the information. There is no backend/server. Whenever Mozilla Common Voice makes a new dataset release, this utility will follow.

With this utility you can:

- View the data in table format or as graphs.
- You can select some languages and make some compeerative analysis.
- You can see how a language is doing across versions and/or wrt to other languages.
- We added some ready made query tools, or you can create your own to answer questions like "what languages have between 100-200 hours of validated data".

In upcoming version:

- You will be able to export the graphs
- You will be able to export the table you are viewing
- And probably many more... Why not request what you need?
