## Description

Metadata for Mozilla Common Voice releases is published as separate JSON files after each release in a separate GitHub repository (see [Common Voice Dataset](https://github.com/common-voice/cv-dataset)). They contain basic but important aggregated information which dataset engineers, community managers, or trainers frequently reference. On the other, hand accessing this information on a GitHub repo and finding what you are looking for, in multiple large JSON files is very time-consuming, especially if you work on multiple languages, and multiple versions and want to compare them.

Common Voice Metadata Viewer tries to solve this problem. It uses a flattened dataframe file generated by the Common Voice Toolbox utility and uses it like an embedded "database" to interactively show the information. There is no backend/server. Whenever Mozilla Common Voice makes a new dataset release, this utility will follow with a new release.

With this utility, you can:

- View the data in table format or as graphs.
- Filter the versions you are interested in
- Select some languages and make some comparative analysis.
- See how a language is doing across versions and/or wrt to other languages.
- See the overall totals of the Common Voice project

If you need more detailed data on a particular dataset, you can use the sister app [Common Voice Dataset Analyzer](https://analyzer.cv-toolbox.web.tr) ([Beta Mirror](https://cv-dataset-analyzer.netlify.app/)).

```

### TODO

- Annotate and export tables and graphs (annotation is missing)
- A graph creator for your own graphs
- Add higher-level query tools, e.g. "What languages have between 100-200 hours of validated data".
- Add grouping for major major language families.

The whole list is under the [project](https://github.com/users/HarikalarKutusu/projects/9/views/1?filterQuery=) in github.
